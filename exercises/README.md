Exercise #1 - Basic Food Ordering System

Topics Covered:
  * String
  * input
  * parsing 
  * lists
  * dictionaries


# Instructions:
  You are hired to program an easy to use food ordering system.
  Your system need to support commands with the following syntax
    
  ```
  COMMAND ARG1 ARG2 ARG3 ARG4
  ```
  
  Required Commands:
  * food addition & removal
    
    ```"add" [/ "remove"] "food1" "food2" "food3" ... ``` - where by each food is the food to add
      
    example: ```new Pizza Pasta Potatos```
    
  * order new food
          
    ```"order" "food1:amound2" "food2:amound2" ...```
          
    example: ```order pizza:1 pasta:2```
    
  * print order status - prints which foods have been ordered and amount ordered
  
    "status"
    
    example: ```status```
    
    
    example output:
      ```
          Pizza   -  2
          Pasta   -  3
          Potatos -  0
      ```
    
  * reset orders - resets all foods to 0
  
    "reset"
    
    example: reset
