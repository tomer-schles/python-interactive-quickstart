# Tomer's Interactive Python ineractive Quickstart guide
This guide is intended for people who wish to jump write on the python train, and believe me, its an awesome one.
This guide is probably most suited for programmers already experienced in another programming language.


This was orignally written for helping my awesome bro **Lukas Vordermann** quickly hop on the python train for a cool project together :)


For any suggestions, improvments, questions you are welcome to create pull requests, open issues or contact me.

Also, if somebody wants to get involved, they are more then welcome!
